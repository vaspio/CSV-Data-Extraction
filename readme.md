## exercise.py
Run: ```python exercise.py CUSTOMER_SAMPLE.CSV```

The program takes the the customer sample input file and creates three smaller files containing extracted customer data from the full extraction csv files.
It is worthy to note that I used python sets when I needed to keep customer and invoices codes to achieve best performance.

## create_sample.py
Run: ```python create_sample.py ```

The program open the CUSTOMER.CSV file and creates a sample file with a test sample of 1000 customers.
